### Introduction
簡介

Open data programs provide a number of important benefits for governments and the citizens they serve. At the most basic level, these programs provide important insights into government activities—a fundamental ingredient for a well-operating democracy.

開放資料計畫提供政府和其服務的市民許多重大的效益。從最基本層面說起，這些計畫為政府運作提供了重要的啟示 - 良好民主運作的基本元素。

In addition to enhanced government transparency, these programs also provide a means for developing new applications and solutions—built on top of the data released by governments—that can be leveraged to deliver public services. These programs also highlight some of the longstanding problems with incumbent processes that are used by governments to procure technology solutions and services and provide insight into how these older processes might be improved.
除了加強政府的透明度之外，開放資料計畫也提供了工具或方法使得基於這些政府開放出來的資料能進一步被發展成其他新應用和解決方案，並借勢進而提供更多公共服務。這些計畫也突顯了有部份政府用來採購技術方案和服務所孕成的長期性計畫，並且提供何改善這些舊有流程的啟示。

### Unlocking the Power of Open Data
解放開放資料的力量

The concept of “government as a platform”—an idea best, and most famously, articulated by Tim O’Reilly (2010), the founder of O’Reilly Media and a leading proponent of free-software and open source movements—often references the iPhone as an example of a platform done well. The decision in 2008 by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs to allow independent developers to build apps that would work on the iPhone “platform” has made the now ubiquitous device the success that it is. As noted in a 2012 *New York Times* article by David Streitfeld:
Tim O'Reilly (2010) - O'Reilly Media創始人，同時為免費軟體與開源運動的推動者 - 提出"政府即平台"的概念。iPhone經常被拿來當一個好平台的典範。2008年由蘋果執行長Steve Jobs決定要讓各自獨立的開發者所開放的apps都能在iPhone平台上運作，造成了現在iPhone無所不在的成功。一如2012年New York Times中David Streitfeld的文章中提到：

> The App Store opened in July 2008 with 500 apps. In an interview, Mr. Jobs laid bare the company’s goal: “Sell more iPhones.” Thanks to the multitude of apps, the goal came to pass. More iPhones... were sold in the next three months than in the entire previous year, and that was just the beginning of the ascent. (Streitfeld, 2012)
> App Store在2008年7月開放時只有500個app。在一次訪談中，Jobs先生揭露了公司目標："再賣更多iPhone"。感謝這一大群app，這個目標達成了。在接下來三個月，iPhone的銷售量比過去一整年還多，而那只是iPhone熱潮的起點。

The idea of turning a phone into an application platform has since been copied by other hardware and software companies, and it has informed the idea of turning government itself into a platform. Providing public access to government data in machine-readable formats (i.e., open data) is the foundation of the efforts being taken by governments around the world. They are essentially copying Apple’s approach to stimulate innovative new apps and ideas that can run on their government “platform.”
把電話變成一個應用平台的想法因此被複製到其他的軟、硬體公司，進而帶出來政府也可以把自己成為一個平台的概念。開放可使用電腦可讀的格式來對政府資訊公開的存取(例如開放資料)是全球政府第一件可以努力的事。這都是對前述Apple做法核心精神的複製，概念就像是在政府平台上可以執行各種新app的意思。

Open government data is at the heart of a change that is taking place in government. Since the inception of the internet and its now central role in how governments deliver services and information to citizens, governments have used data as an input into a finished product delivered by them for those they serve. Open data, for many governments, has now become the finished product that is delivered to its end-users—independent developers who can use open government data to develop innovative and valuable new solutions.
開放政府資料位於這場改變的核心。由於網際網路的介入，網路已成為政府對市民提供服務禾資訊的主要管道。政府遇去把資料當做是提供市民服務的素材之一。開放資料，對於多政府而言，已被用來當作政府提供給獨立開發的的素材，並能自行開發出創新又有價值的新產品。

This kind of change in government can be long, complex, and fraught with risks. It requires a rethinking of government’s traditional role of sole solution provider (the entity that builds, or contracts for, the customer-facing components through which public services are delivered) to that of a data steward. A 2012 report by the Center for Technology in Government noted the transformational dynamics created by open data programs:
在政府內這類型的改變可能得花很長的時間、很複雜、而且很具誤導的風險。這需要重新思考傳統觀念中政府是這些資料唯一的「解決方案提供者」的角色定位。一份2012年政府科技中心的報告指出，開放資料的計畫會帶來以下這些改變：

> Open data initiatives disrupt government’s traditional role as holder or owner of the data. In thinking about open data governance, we need to rethink government’s role in relation to the entire set of new stakeholders. One possibility is to characterize government, as well as all other stakeholders, as stewards [of data]. (Helbig, Cresswell, Burke, & Luna-Reyes, 2012, p. 13)
> 開放資料的倡行，瓦解了傳統上政府做為資料保管者或資料攏有者的角色。思考開放資料的政治時，我們需要重新定位政府與整個生態鏈的角色。一種可能性是把政府和其他生態鏈上的關係人都一樣視為是資料的保管者。

The clearest example of how open government data can be used to encourage the development of useful new applications comes from the world of public transit. There are numerous examples of applications built using transit data released by governments with the GTFS specification, which is an open data format initially developed by Google in cooperation with Portland, Oregon’s public transit agency. While initially designed to allow easy integration of transit data into the Google platform, the GTFS data specification has spawned a cottage industry of new transit apps. Websites like citygoround.org list hundreds of transit apps, many built using GTFS data.
大眾運輸是開放政府資料如何能用來鼓勵發展有用的新應用最清楚的例子。有非常多的應用例子是基於政府開放的運輸資料和GTFS規格-一種由Google和Portland(Oregon的大眾運輸公司)共同制定的開放資料格式。最早GTFS的設計是基於要能容易地把運輸資料整合進Google的平台，後來GTFS規格衍生了一些新的交通運輸 app的產業。citygoround.org這類型的網站列出了上百個交通運輸app，大多都是其於GTFS資料所開發的。

These applications have fundamentally changed the way that riders on public transportation systems consume transit data, as well as the role of transit authorities in relation to how these applications are developed. In the past, the transit agencies themselves would have been the entity that designed, developed, and delivered the apps used by riders to get information—and many still do. However, an increasing number of transit agencies are getting out of the business of developing these kinds of customer-facing apps and are letting the new app market (fueled by the open GTFS data they release) meet rider demand instead.
這些應用從根本上改變了乘客在大眾運輸系統中使用資料的模式，也改變了大眾運輸公司之間的角色。在過去，大眾運輸公司得自行設計、開發、並提供這些app讓乘客取得資訊 - 有許多公司還是這樣做。然而，逐漸有大眾運輸公司不再開發這類型的客戶app，而改讓這些因開放GTFS資料所產生的新的app市場去滿足乘客的需求。

In addition, some transit agencies—like the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which serves the Philadelphia area—are now actively advertising apps built by independent developers to their riders.
甚至，有些大眾運輸公司-例如東南賓夕凡尼亞運輸公司-現在還幫一些獨立開發者開發的app打廣告。(因為這些app的服務對象是這家公司服務區域的乘客。)

### Beyond Public Transit: The Limits of Open Data
### 開放資料的限制


This fundamental shift away from government as the sole solution provider to a data steward is now taking hold outside the world of transit data, fostering the growth of new ideas and solutions.
這個將政府從獨佔的解決方案提供者的角色轉變為資料看管者的根本性轉移，現在已經在大眾運輸之外的領域開花結果，並且帶動更多新想法和新應用的成長。

Leveraging open data to encourage the development of useful applications and services holds many benefits for governments. With this approach, new ways of building software and deploying solutions are developed without them having to make bets on specific technologies (something that governments do not do well). Independent developers operating outside of the normal government procurement process are often better positioned to leverage new advances in app development or service deployment.
借助開放資料的力量來鼓勵發展有用的應用服務，對政府而言有許多利益。採用這個方法，新發展出來的軟體和服務病案不需要政府來制定最好的規格或技術(其實政府也不太擅長)。不在政府採購流程下運作的獨立開發者通常有更好的態勢來發展新應用或服務方案。

Open government data is one way that governments can, in a sense, go around the traditional procurement process to encourage the development of useful software. However, this approach does have some limitations. Implicit in the idea of open data is the fact that governments can’t dictate what users of the data actually do with it (provided they don’t misrepresent the data or otherwise violate terms of use). Publishing open data and engaging outside developers can be a less-than-effective strategy if governments hope to achieve the development of specific tools or solutions.
公開政府資料是一種政府能以傳統採購流程以外，鼓勵開發有用軟體的方法。然而，這種方法也的確有一些限制。開發資料的概念，隱含了政府不能決定使用者會把這些資料拿來做什麼運用(假定他們不會扭曲資料、或是做出其他違反條款的事)。如果政府想要指定某種工具或解決方案的開發，那麼發行開放資料和解觸外界的開發者對政府而言是一件低效益的事。

The open data approachs best to generate emergent (rather than prescriptive), customer-facing applications that are related to particular kinds of data that have established communities or constituencies of enthusiasts (like transit data). Releasing open data and engaging outside developers to organically develop solutions is not the right approach for the development of all government IT systems. For example, this would be less than ideal for the development of a back-end accounting or financial management system, which requires specialized knowledge of government processes and would likely need to be built to exacting specifications. When governments have specific needs or detailed requirements for how a solution or app should be built and operated, standard government procurement is probably a better way to acquire this technology than hackathons or apps contests.
開放資料的做法最適於產生不預期的(而非精確的)、直接面對客戶的，與某種特定資料相關而能建立某種社群或熱心的族群的應用(例如大眾運輸資料)。釋出開發資料和接觸外部開發者並一步步發展解決方案並不是發展任何政府IT系統的正確做法。舉例，這絕非是用來發展後台會計或財務管理系統的理想做法，通常那會需要對政府流程深度的了解，並且應該會具有很明確的規格。當政府定得出他們想要的規格的話，走傳統政府採購做法會是比起辦比賽或hackathons還更合適的做法。

However, the government procurement process as it exists today is not ideal for acquiring optimal technology solutions that take advantage of the latest thinking on how software and services are developed and deployed. Viewed as cumbersome and complex, the process used by public sector entities to procure goods and services is often cited as a major barrier to introducing innovation—particularly the use of new technologies—into government operations.
然而，今日的政府採購流程並不是很適合用於購入具有軟體發展最新優勢的最佳技術解決方案上。這些又笨重又複雜的流程，本身就是對政府運作中引進科技創新的最大阻礙。

### Looking Ahead: Three Hard Truths for Government Procurement Reform
向前看：政府採購改革困難的三件實情

Advancing the innovation agenda within government often means confronting the harsh reality of the government procurement process. This is not a new problem, and there are a number of initiatives underway in governments around the country aimed at “streamlining” or “overhauling” the government procurement process to support the acquisition of new technologies and projects that engage smaller and more nimble companies with new solutions.
在政府內促成創新議題通常代表會面對政府採購流程的嚴苛現實。這並不是什麼新的問題，全國各地有很多針對政府採購流程"效率化"或"全面診斷"的議案正在進行中，以便能從一些較小、較靈敏的公司購入新科技或專案。

The City of Philadelphia, in particular, is engaged in some progressive efforts to use the government procurement process as a means to develop an ecosystem of smaller companies that offer innovative new ideas to longstanding city problems. If the goal of using the procurement process to stimulate (or at least not hinder) innovation inside government is to be realized, reformers in Philadelphia and elsewhere will need to face some hard truths about procurement reform.
尤其是費城市，正努力籌備一些較新穎的政府採購流程，以便能發展一個由小型公司組成的生態鏈來提供創新的想法來解決長期的城市問題。如果使用此採購流程激勵(至少不要阻礙)政府內創新的目標實現了，費城市或其他地方的改革者必須面對一些採購改革困難的實情。

In addition, advocates of procurement reform must expand their thinking about the nature of reform and their methods to bring about change by focusing on open government data as a foundational component for systematic change in how governments deliver services and information to those they serve.
此外，採購改革的擁護者必須更周延地思考關於改革思維的本質，以及針對以開放政府資料為基礎來進行政府對提供服務和資訊的系統層改變的方法。

#### Balancing Values
平衡價值

The arguments in favor of reforming the government procurement process bear a striking similarity to arguments used by advocates for overhauling the federal income tax system. Both sets of advocates point to the problem of unnecessary complexity as an element that can stifle innovation or even harm participants. In many instances, the same verbs are used when calling for reform—words like “overhaul” and “streamline” can be used almost interchangeably when talking about tax reform and procurement reform.
讚同改革政府採購流程的論點也為擁護對聯邦所得稅系統進行全面檢修的論點提供了相似的火力。兩組擁護者都指出問題在於不必要的複雜性會厄殺了創新，甚至會傷害參與者。在許多案例中，當談到稅務改革和採購改革時，"改革(reform)"也會和如"全面檢修(overhaul)"或"效率改產(streamline"等其他的字混著使用。

The federal income tax system is a useful reference for talking about procurement reform. It is often used by governments as a vehicle for achieving desired outcomes that (as many economists will quickly point out) have nothing to do with an efficient tax system. We imbue our tax code with certain provisions that, we hope, will help achieve outcomes deemed to have broad societal value.
當談到採購改革時，所得稅系統是一個有用的參考。它經常被政府用來當做一個為成預期產出的工作，但(許多經濟學家容易就指出)它完全是一套沒有效率的稅務系統。我們一直都以為，也期待著我們的稅收和相關條款是朝著達生更高的社會價值。

A perfect example of this is the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest. As a country and a society, we value homeownership over other kinds of investments, so our tax system “rewards” this investment with a special deduction. The objective is to encourage more homeownership because it is highly correlated with desired outcomes, like higher property values and more stable neighborhoods. This deduction comes with a cost, however: it increases the complexity of tax forms, and it increases the effort required both to process these forms and to audit taxpayer compliance.
有個很棒的例子是聯邦所得稅的抵押品利息扣抵。從國家社會的觀點來看，自有房屋的投資是被視為比其他投資更重要的。所以我們的稅務系統透過特別抵減來"獎勵"這項投資，其目的是鼓勵更高的自有房屋率，因為這和期望的結果有很高的相關性。例如更高的國民財產總值和更穩定的鄰里情誼。然而，這項抵減是有其成本的，它也增加了稅單的複雜性或處理這些申請及稽核的相關流程和工作。

There are many other examples of income tax provisions that are specifically engineered to produce outcomes with broad social benefits—a myriad of deductions and credits for married couples, particularly those with children; deductions for contributions made to charities; and deductions for interest on student loans. Each of these examples shares two characteristics: they are designed to encourage specific outcomes, and they increase the overall complexity of the system. On an individual level, the cost of these broader societal benefits manifests as more time and effort to comply with income tax requirements.
還有很多其他關於所得稅金分配的例子，是特別設計來鼓勵更多社會利益的發生。例如對已婚者大量的稅金抵減，特別是有孩子的家庭；對慈善捐款的稅金抵減；對就學貸款的稅金抵減。每一個例子都有兩個共同的特徵：它們是為了鼓勵特定的行為，同時增加了系統的整體複雜性。以個人層級來看，這些廣義社會福利的隱藏成本顯得比公司層級的所得稅還需要花更多時間和精神。

Procurement processes are similar in many ways. Governments imbue these processes with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.
政府採購流程也有許多雷同之處。政府在採購流程中灌入需求規格和其他各種契約，希望能引導出期望的結果。每一項規格其實都增加流程的複雜性，並對需求建議書(Request For Proposal, RPF)的公司造成許多障礙。

For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.
舉例，機乎每個政府機關都有發過採購規格給弱勢企業或女性創業的企業，還有很多需求是偏向以當地的公司優先考量。這些限制的目的是要引導政府採購的費用會流向弱勢企業、女性創業家和當地企業，並創近當地的工作機會和稅收。

There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.
還有許多包羅萬象的價值隱藏在採購流程的設計中。例如，要公平、公開地把採購需求、招標、相關文仵予以公佈、甚至包含與供應商的會議和明確的投標時間與相關規定。

Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.
風險規避，另一項採購流程的優點，也是造成採購流程的複雜性的主因。包括對效能、規格、供應商保險、供應商財報的詳細檢查、財務儲備金等，這些項目都是為了降低當政府與一家公司合作過程中所可能產生的風險。以上任一項目都會讓採購流程變得更複雜、並對投標者造成障礙 - 特別是小公司更慘。

All of this underscores the point that many of the factors that make government procurement processes complex and slow are also things that are intended to produce desired outcomes. These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.
很明顯地，許多使政府採購流程變得複雜、緩慢的因素，其本身也是為了確定產出規格或結果而存在。採購流程的這些特性是為了特殊的意團而設計的，很少人會質疑那些值得讚揚的背後目標。然而，這些需求的副作用是它們把流程變慢、變複雜，並且使得一些體制較小而靈活公司更難以加入了。

Efforts to overhaul or streamline the procurement process will undoubtedly run up against the provisions just discussed. Are there ways to streamline the procurement process that don’t require provisions of this type to be relaxed or removed, or are there ways to relax these provisions without compromising the laudable outcomes they seek to encourage? This remains to be seen.
對採購流程的全面檢修或效率改革的努力，無疑地將與前述的條款產生衝突。有沒有其他方法可以把採購流程朝著鬆綁或取消這些不需要的條款的方向改善，或是在鬆綁這些條款時無需造成這些值得讚揚的背後原因被妥協？這還有待觀察。

#### Nimbler Doesn’t Always Mean Better
靈活不一定比較好

The great myth in government IT is that the private sector is always way ahead of the public sector in how technology is used.
在政府IT內的大迷思是：對於科技如何使用的議題，，私領域總是擋在公領域之前。

In between two tours of duty in state and local government, I spent about ten years in the private sector working for both large and small technology firms. Before joining Code for America as Director of Government Relations in 2011, I worked for four different technology companies headquartered in places as different as Horsham, Pennsylvania; Blacksburg, Virginia; and San Francisco, California. I learned a lot about technology and how to be a software developer during this time, but I also learned that—as far as technology is concerned—the grass is not always greener on the other side.
在洲政府和地方政府兩段工作之間，我有10年時間，分別在大型和小型的私人科技公司工作。

There are plenty of examples of poor technology decisions in the private sector. We just hear about them less often because they are usually not a matter of public record or visible to the public through a budget submission or legislative hearing.

To be sure, governments around the world have issues with implementing technology, but some of the things I’ve seen in the private sector have been shocking—inexcusably bad decisions made by people who should know better, a complete lack of strategic thinking about how technology is used to benefit the company, and dragging old legacy technology along far past its point of usefulness simply because upgrading would be tricky and complex—the list goes on. The private sector has all of these problems and more. We just don’t hear about them as much.

What my experience in the private sector made exceedingly clear to me is that it is entirely possible (and not very unusual) for private sector organizations, unshackled by complicated procurement processes like those used by governments, to make lousy choices and invest poorly in technology.

Simply making the government procurement process “simpler” won’t guarantee that better IT decisions get made. Governments will still need to think more strategically about how they invest in technology and become better at learning how it can be used to make the delivery of public services more efficient and effective.

#### A Dearth of Makers Inside Government

My experience working as a software developer for several years, and continuing to work with other developers from a variety of disciplines for years after that, has affected the way I approach problems. Whenever I hear about an application or service or an idea someone has for one, I’m often privately thinking (as I think most people who have worked as developers are), how would I build something like that? This is probably true of most people who have built things for a living.

Understanding how things work and how to build them can be a useful skill when evaluating the level of effort required to perform a service or to solve a problem. This is something software developers do often—estimate the amount of time it will take them (or their team) to complete a series of tasks they have not yet begun. It’s hard to do well. Even software developers who do this often will sometimes underestimate or overestimate the amount of time required to complete a task.

The ability to translate a problem into a series of steps that a person can imagine herself doing is the specific byproduct of making things. This is a problem in government, where, in general, there is a woeful lack of awareness about how things are made and what resources and materials are required to build things. In short, there is a critical lack of makers in government.

This problem is particularly acute when it comes to technology and how governments acquire it, even for needs that should be simple and relatively cheap, like content management systems for websites and web-based applications. The web is now an essential component of how governments deliver services and communicate with citizens, and yet, there are far too few people inside government (including those in the technology discipline) who have a solid understanding of how the internet works.

In just the last few years, the world of software development has seen a sea change that has transformed how web and mobile applications are built. Never before has it been easier or cheaper to build these applications. Yet governments continue to overpay for them (or the services of those firms that build them) because there is very little in-house knowledge of how these things are built.

This is not to suggest that effective websites and useful web applications are easy to build and don’t require skill. They certainly do, but without a fundamental understanding of what the technologies behind these applications are, how they work, and how they are changing, governments cannot distinguish the skilled vendors offering reasonably priced solutions from the shysters.

In a way, it’s not dissimilar from the experience many people have when going to an auto mechanic—if you don’t know anything about how cars work, how do you know for sure if you’re getting a fair price? It calls to mind the classic episode from the sitcom “Seinfeld,” where George Costanza sums up the typical approach to auto repair like this:

> Well of course they’re trying to screw you! What do you think? That’s what they do. They can make up anything; nobody knows! ‘Why, well you need a new Johnson rod in here.’ Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well better put one of those on!

If the people who work for government don’t have a clear enough sense of how things get made, they are ill-equipped to evaluate RFP responses from individuals or companies that want to do work on behalf of the government. This is especially important for technology procurement, where new software development paradigms can evolve rapidly.

Governments need to place an emphasis on recruiting and hiring people who have experience making things. In addition, governments need to focus on developing the “maker skills” of existing employees. This, by extension, will enhance the ability of governments to evaluate the estimates for work provided by respondents to RFPs.

### Conclusion

Government open data programs and the independent apps they help generate provide tremendously helpful ways of fostering new approaches to old problems. They also support the application of new technologies and app development strategies for delivering public services.

However, even the most robust open data program is not a suitable replacement for a well-designed and properly functioning procurement process—one that fosters innovation and the risk that is inherent in it. Open data programs can—and should—complement well-designed procurement processes.

Open data programs have opened the door to new ways of thinking about how public services are delivered. They also help highlight some of the deficiencies in the existing processes used to acquire solutions by government and deliver services and information.

The job of overhauling existing government procurement processes to encourage innovation will not be an easy one, but one of the many benefits of open data is that it has led to this important discussion.
