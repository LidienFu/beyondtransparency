### The Bigger Picture: Ten Lessons for Taking Open Government Further
### 眼光放遠：帶領開放政府往前邁進的十堂課

My job at the Knight Foundation is to identify people with promising ideas and help them execute them. Our primary tool for that is the Knight News Challenge, through which we’ve supported nearly a hundred projects, with more than $30 million over six years. We’ve supported several open government-related projects and groups like LocalWiki, the Open Knowledge Foundation, Ushahidi, EveryBlock, and Open Street Maps.

我在騎士基金會(Knight Foundation)的工作專門負責發掘擁令人感動的構想，並幫助發起人完成這些想法。騎士基金會主要使用我們自己的官網 - Knight News Challenge - 來當做收集構想的平台，六年來我們已經資助了上百個計畫，總額超過3千萬美金。我們資助過好幾個開放政府相關的計畫和團體，例如LocalWiki、開放知識基金會(Open Knowledge Foundation)、Ushahidi(一個快速報導新聞的社群網站)、EveryBlock(以在地街區為單位的社群網站)和Open Street Maps(相當於Google Map的開源計畫)。

The code, insights, and talent networks we’ve supported through the News Challenge moved us to focus a recent iteration on open government. Our goal was to expand the table of people who engage with open government. In addition to practical open government applications, we hoped to uncover ideas about how the internet can change the ways in which citizens and governments interact. We wanted to involve more people in the use of technology to solve community problems, and we sought to expand the geographic footprint beyond what’s become the standard open government metropoles of San Francisco, Chicago, and the Boston-New York- DC Acela nexus. Silently, I hoped that at least one of the winners would not even consider themselves as part of the open government movement.

隨著我們在News Challenge上資助過的程式開發、創新想法和高手人脈等成果，我們漸漸自然地朝向開放政府的方向發展。我們的目標是讓更多從事開放政府的人加入。除了開放政府相關的有用App外，我們也希望探索怎麼讓網際網路改變政府與市民的互動模式。我們希望拉進更多人一起來使用科技解決社區問題，我們想要把開放政府從舊金山、芝加哥、波士頓和紐約這些開放政府的典範向外擴展。我偷偷的希望，至少有一個獲得贊助的個人或團體不要覺得自己已經在進行開放政府的運動了。


During the application period, we partnered with locally based organizations to conduct events in fourteen cities, including less typical open government cities, like Lexington, Kentucky; Macon, Georgia; San Diego; and St. Paul, Minnesota. Out of the 860 submissions we received, several themes emerged that captured the open government zeitgeist. These included:

在申請期間，我們與當地的組織合作，推動在十四個城市的活動，包括非典型的開放政府，像肯德基州的Lexinton、喬治亞州的Macon、聖地牙哥和明尼蘇達州的聖保羅。在我們收到的860份申請中，有幾個主題抓住了開放政府的時代精神，包括：

* Increasing citizens’ direct participation in policymaking
* Strengthening policies for data transparency
* Making sense out of multiple datasets
* Understanding government spending and campaign contributions
* Making better use of public spaces and vacant land

* 提高市民直接參與政策制定
* 強化資料透通的相關政策
* 讓數幾組資料集(Dataset)的資料變得對民眾有意義
* 了解政府開銷和行銷活動貢獻到哪些地方去
* 對公眾空間或空地更有效的運用

After our analysis of the contest process and submissions, our assessment was that open government is generating more aspirational ideas than practical tools and approaches that address citizens’ needs and wants. We learned a lot by talking directly with civic leaders, government officials, and hackers, particularly with those outside of the leading open government cities. I spoke with high-ranking government workers who were worried about the security and sustainability of open source projects, elected officials who were curious about citizen demand for data, and journalists who were dubious about governments’ commitment to openness.

在分析過競賽過程和參賽的團體後，我們認為，與其說是產出對市民有用的工具，或想要的服務，開放政府其實製造了更多有創見的想法。在與公民領袖、政府官員和軟體高手對談的過程中我們學到了很多，特別是在那些在「開放政府」做得很沒那麼好的外圍城市。高級政府職員談到他們很擔心機密問題和開放程式碼的永續性；民選官員談到他們沒想到原來市民有對資料的需求；還有一些記者說他們對政府的承諾及開放性感到半信半疑等等。

Our trustees ended up approving eight projects as winners. Not coincidentally, each of the eight had already demonstrated their idea and was able to talk to us about what was and was not working. Also, for the most part, they have been around the open government block for a while. (My hopes of supporting people entirely new to the field failed.)

最後董事會選定了八個計畫。無獨有偶，每一個獲選的計畫都已經展示過他們的想法，並能和我們討論到哪些部份已經可以運作，哪些部份還不行。同時，他們大部份，都已在開放政府這個區塊上跑了一陣子。（我原本想要援助新加入這個領域的初心者的希望落空了。）

Fundamentally, the eight winning projects are practical rather than aspirational. They address identified needs of citizens and governments. Despite our exhortations, few of the ideas that made it to the final rounds re-imagined democracy in the age of the internet. They are about building practical tools that citizen-consumers can use to more easily build businesses, reclaim abandoned land, and sell services to the government. They don’t seek to engage citizens in re-imagining democracy or co-creating their communities. That could reflect the bias of the Knight Foundation and the investors, journalists, and developers who advised us, but the list may also be a reflection of where the open government movement is at this point in its development: in a field driven by aspiration, the value lies in practical businesses and services.

其本上，這八個計畫可說是務實大於理想。他們都點出市民和政府的需求。儘管我們有些囑託，仍有幾個進入決選的計畫在網際網路的世代重塑了民主的形象。他們大多建立了實用的工具，讓市民能夠更簡易地創立企業、回收廢棄土地、以及將服務販賣給政府。他們不追求要市民重塑民主或共建社群。這也許是反映了騎士基金會和投資者、記者和開發者等人對我們的建言的落差。但也反映了開放政府正處於發展的階段：在志向所驅之處，其價值乃是存於務實的事業和服務。

For a guide on moving more robustly from the aspirational to the practical, we might look to Kevin Costner. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kevin Costner was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Near the apex of his career, Costner starred in Field of Dreams, a 1989 fantasy-drama designed to make high school jocks weep. Prompted by the whispers of a disembodied voice, Costner’s character plows under his cornfield, turning it into a baseball diamond for ghosts from the 1919 Chicago White Sox. “If you build it, he will come,” the voice promises him.

想知道怎麼穩健地從理想朝務實前進的，我們不妨回顧一下凱文科斯納（Kevin Costner）。在1980年代末期及1990年代早起，凱文科斯納是好萊塢最著名的巨星之一。在他事業的高峰，科斯納在夢幻成真(Field of Dreams)演出主角，這部奇幻電影讓許多高中運動員感動落淚。受到鬼魂或幻覺的暗示，劇中的科斯納把他的玉米田整理成了一座棒球場，好讓1919年芝加哥哥白襪隊的鬼魂們可以上場打球。那個聲音對他保證：「只要你弄好場地，祂就會來。」

“If we build it, they will come,” has been open government’s operative mode for the last few years. Like other social movements before it, open government is inspired by dreams of what might be, not on an evidence-based assessment of what people want or need. It’s a movement based on the belief that by pushing out data, our fellow citizens will build things, government will be more efficient, and we will all live happier lives. Inevitably, we’ve been disappointed when those idealistic outcomes don’t pan out and we realize that the vast majority of our neighbors lack the skills, wherewithal, time, or inclination to actively participate. Our aspirations for engagement have outpaced the reality—a status appropriate for such a young social project. As open government emerges into adolescence, though, we need to bridge the gaps between innovators and citizens, who are the ultimate users.

「只要我們弄好場地，他們就會來。」已在過去幾年成為開放政府的運動模式。一如之前的社會運動，開放政府也是啟發於可能成真的夢想，而非經過實證的群眾需求。這是一項基於「靠著推出資料，就會有市民開始建立一些東西、政府會變得更有效率、大家都會活得更幸福」的信念的社會運動。無可避免地，當這些事情沒發生時我們會受到失望的打擊，我們也了解，身邊的鄰居通常缺乏足夠的技能、資金、時間或意願地參與這些活動。我們對參與的期望已經超過了現實 - 這大抵是這類新型態的社會計畫所會遇到的情況。當開放政府進入「青春期」般的快速發展時，我們還需連結創新者和一般市民之間的落差，特別是當一般市民才是最終的使用者的情況下。

To make that leap, we need to consider a later Kevin Costner movie: The Postman. Based on David Brin’s 1985 post-apocalyptic fantasy novel, this movie features Costner playing a drifter who dons the uniform and identity of a dead mail carrier. In so doing, he inadvertently becomes the personification of the disbanded US government. Costner’s uniform and the act of distributing mail between previously disconnected towns rekindle a civic spirit among those he visits. (The movie was a dog, but Brin’s novel is pretty great.)

要想奮力一躍，我們還得看看凱文科斯納後期的另一部電影：終極神差(The Postman)，原著是David Brin於1985年的末日後奇幻小說。這部電影中科斯納飾演一名天災後無政府狀態下的流浪漢，他無意間發現了一具郵差的屍體，並拿了這名郵差的衣服和身份以求一頓溫飽；並因此漸漸化身為破碎的政府的重塑者。他的一身制服和在原本中斷聯繫的城鎮間傳遞信件的行動，讓收到親人消息的人們，重新燃起了對生命的希望（電影本身拍得蠻差的，但原著小說非常優）。

How does open government move from building fields of dreams to delivering like a postman? How do we stop making baseball fields out of Iowa cornfields and start going town-to-town, knocking on doors, and building links, one community at a time? Now that we have the vision of it all down, it’s time to shift into the practicalities of building useful tools. Here are ten things we need to prioritize to move from dreaming to doing:

開放政府要怎麼從整頓夢想場地的農夫，進化到連接城市間的郵差呢？我們要怎麼從單點整備，進化到城市間的連結、敲開大門、同時建立連結和社群呢？目前我們對於這些全都完成的願景已有概念，是時候開始建立有用的工具了。以下10道課題是當我們想從「做夢」到進化為「做事」必須優先思考的：


#### Realistic Expectations
#### 符合現實的期望

We need to learn how to build projects and businesses that bring value to customers, not just venture capitalist moonshots. Civic technology will not produce companies with a hundred times the return on investment. We need to be okay with that and build the financing and support services that will enable entrepreneurs’ visions to become real and sustainable.

我們得學會創造真的能為客戶帶來價值的企業和專案，而不只是給創投看的登月計畫。公民科技並不會產生超過百倍投資報酬率的公司。我們得接受這個事實，並得建立具有創業家願景、且能實際永續經營的財務及支援服務。


#### Delight
#### 樂趣

No one waits excitedly at the window for the postman to deliver us information about voting, taxes, or municipal budgets. Messages from loved ones, narratives in magazines, and holiday cards are what I look for when the mail arrives. We need apps and tools that are fun to use and don’t feel like homework.

沒有人會滿懷期待地等著郵差送來選舉通知、稅單或著政府預算。以我個人來說，我只期待收到親人的信件、我訂的雜誌和節慶賀卡。我們需要的App和工具必須是有趣，特別是要避免像是家庭作業那種感覺。

#### Drama
#### 戲劇性

“We have 2,000 bills. Little bill bits,” said California Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year. “You can’t run a world on bill bits. That’s not what moves people. There has to be drama. Protagonist and antagonist. We’re on the stage of history here.” We need to do a better job of taking civic data and presenting it to our neighbors in stories, visualizations, and culture.

「我們有2,000條法案。這只是一小部份」幾前年加州官員Jerry Brown說道：「但這個世界不會因為一些法案而轉動，那種東西不能感動人心。必須得要有一些戲劇性、主角和對手。我們就像站在歷史的舞台上。」取用公眾資料時，我們還得用更生動的方式來呈現給鄉民，包括注重故事性、視覺化及考慮大家可接受的文化。

#### Literacy
#### 讀寫能力

To appreciate the mail, it helps to be able to read. What are the skills and approaches citizens need to contribute to and benefit from open government, and how do we identify and develop them?

要想感受收信的感動，識字的能力是基本的。那麼，市民要有哪些技能，才能對開放政府做出貢獻或受益呢？我們要怎麼指出這些技術並培養它們呢？

#### Research
#### 研究

What is the baseline for what does and does not work? How do we know how we’re doing and determine what to do better? What are we measuring? How do we know whether what we’re doing works, and how can we brag to others about it? How can we demonstrate an ROI to governments and potential investors? The fact that we don’t have answers to these questions this late in the game is worrisome.

一件東西有用或沒用的評估底線是什麼？我們要怎麼知道該怎麼進行、或是怎麼做比較好？我們要評估什麼？我們怎麼確保我們做的事有用？甚至要怎麼跟別人吹噓成果？要怎麼向政府和投資人展示投資報酬率(ROI)？如果在這場競賽中，到了中後期我們都答不出這些問題的話，就有點令人擔心了。

#### Models
#### 參考模型

When people ask us how to do open government, where can we point them? We need solid, well-documented success stories of real results.

當人們問我們怎麼做開放政府時，我們有例子可以介紹嗎？我們需要明確、文件化的成功案例和實際的成果。

#### Talent
#### 人才

When they need to hire, where do governments go? Programs like the Code for America Fellowship are a great start, but they aren’t enough to form a workforce. We have a great set of leaders, but most of them could fit into one conference. We need to set up places for them to go when they leave government so we don’t lose their experiences and networks to other fields.

當政府需要相關人才時要去哪招募？類似Code for America獎學金是個好的開始，但還不足以型成足夠的勞動力。此外我們有一群很好的領袖，但大概一場研討會的空間就塞得下他們全部了。我們得為他們發展更大、更多的空間，如此一來當他們離開政府往外發展時，他們都還能繼續發揮他們的寶貴經驗和其他領域的人脈。

#### Professional Development
#### 專業培養

Many people who take government jobs don’t do so to be agents of change or to drive innovation. They often take them because they are good, solid jobs. Where do career government workers and civilians go to develop the skills we need to drive the movement forward from the inside out?

很多人進入公職並不是為了成為改革者或創新者，而是因為公職大多是待預不錯的穩定工作。那麼，長期在政府內工作的員工和老百姓要如何發展那些從內到外推動改變所需具備的技能呢？

#### Leadership Transitions
#### 主導權移轉

We put a lot on the shoulders of individual government leaders to drive change. How do we build the systems so that the innovations built by a chief executive are not dismantled with their administration? What tools would help with transitions from one mayor or governor to another?

推動變革時，我們把很多責任壓在政府內個別的主導者身上。我們要如何建立良好的系統，避免這些做事的人所推動的創新被主管部門給拆了？有什麼工具能幫助主導權從市長或統治者過渡到其他人的過程？

#### Risk Tolerance
#### 風險承受

How can we encourage and enable government leaders and workers to take risks that they are generally dissuaded from trying? We need to build a culture inside government that is tolerant of taking smart, well-calculated risks.

對於通常都試著規避風險的政府主管和員工，我們要如何鼓勵他們接受一定的風險？我們得在政府內部建立一種能接受經過精巧計算的風險的文化。

For open government to succeed, it needs to make its principles—transparency, openness, and data-driven decision-making—become synonymous with democracy. In order to fully benefit from the values of sharing and the wisdom of community, we need to move beyond placing our hopes in whispered promises toward doing the practical work of building useful, sustainable tools and a supportive ecosystem.

要想讓開放政府成功，就得讓透明、開放和資料導向的決策過程這些原則和「民主」一樣被重視看待。為了從社群智慧和分享得到最大效益，我們不能只是把希望寄託在小小的承諾上，就以為實務的工作、和建立有用、永續的工具和整個支援的生態會自然生成。
